They called him a grafter, a hypocrite, a Carlist, and a miser: he merely smiled and recited more prayers. The alferez had a little anecdote which he always related to the occasional Spaniards who visited him:</p><p>“Are you going over to the convento to visit the sanctimonious rascal there, the little curate? Yes! Well, if he offers you chocolate which I doubt—but if he offers it remember this: if he calls to the servant and says, ‘Juan, make a cup of chocolate, _eh!_’ then stay without fear; but if he calls out, ‘Juan, make a cup of chocolate, _ah!_’ then take your hat and leave on a run.”</p><p>“What!” the startled visitor would ask, “does he poison people? _Carambas!_”</p></div> </div>
