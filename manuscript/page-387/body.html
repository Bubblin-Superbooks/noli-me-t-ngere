The servants are glad to pay for them in that way and it suits me also. I never resort to blows, only sometimes a pinch, or a whack on the head.”</p><p>“I’m going to do as you do!” “I’ll do the same!” “And I!” exclaimed the women.</p><p>“But suppose the plate is only broken into two or three pieces, then you earn very few,” observed the obstinate Rufa.</p><p>“_Abá!_” answered old Sipa. “I make them recite the prayers anyhow. Then I glue the pieces together again and so lose nothing.”</p><p>Sister Rufa had no more objections left.</p></div> </div>
