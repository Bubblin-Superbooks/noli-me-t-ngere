The alcalde occupied one end of the table and Ibarra the other. At the young manâ€™s right sat Maria Clara and at his left the escribano. Capitan Tiago, the alferez, the gobernadorcillo, the friars, the employees, and the few young ladies who had remained sat, not according to rank, but according to their inclinations. The meal was quite animated and happy.</p></div> </div>
